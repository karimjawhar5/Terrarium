# Terrarium
## Summary:
This is a Terraium Control web app for ESP8266 that allows you to monitor and control your Terraium from a web page. With this app, you can monitor the temperature, humidity, and moisture levels of your Terraium from any device.

##How to use:

An ESP8266 module
A DHT sensor and moisture sensor
A relay switch
2 Bulbs connected in parallel

1. Connect the DHT sensor and moisture sensor to the appropriate pins on the ESP8266 module.
2. Connect the light to pin 5 on the ESP8266 module.
3. Power on the ESP8266 module and connect it to your local wifi network.
4. Take note of the ESP8266's IP address, which can be found in the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.
5. Open your web browser, and enter the ESP8266's IP address in the address bar.
You should now see a web page displaying the temperature, humidity, and moisture levels, along with an "ON" and "OFF" button to control the light in the terraium.

##Future Imporvments
- Add water pump to control watering the terrarium
- Add snails! (To terrium)

This is a web app that can be controlled by web page which allows you to monitor and control your Terraium with the help of ESP8266
